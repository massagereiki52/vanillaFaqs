      <h2 class="close">What does worship mean?</h2>
      <p class="answer">What's the first thing that you think of when you think of the word worship? Most of you will probably think of music, but I'm here to tell you that worship is so much more than just the music. Worship is the life style that you lead, it is the
        tears that you cry, it is the very breath in your lungs. Worship is all of these things and so much more, because worship is infinite.  </p>
